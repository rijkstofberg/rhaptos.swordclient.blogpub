Pyramid has very good documentation; view it at:
    http://docs.pylonsproject.org/docs/pyramid.html

Now let's prepare the environment:
Assuming that you want the project to live in a directory called 'rhaptos', do the following:
* mkdir rhaptos
* cd rhaptos
* git clone git@github.com:rijkstofberg/rhaptos.swordclient.blogpub.git .
* virtualenv --no-site-packages .
* ./bin/easy_install pyramid sqlalchemy zope.sqlalchemy nose coverage
* ./bin/python setup.py develop

Start the blog publishing sword service
* ./bin/paster serve development.ini
